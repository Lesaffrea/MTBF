# MTBF analysis

This project is an exploration of the MTBF. It seems more difficult than thought to come with population results, the context plays a big role it seems in the duration of time between failures.

# Data set

The data set is based on Rio MTBF information, we use two data set for the moment.

# Scripts

1. EDA.rmd The first analysis of the MTBF.

2. Pulley.Rmd:  This analysis is done with the data set **Pulley output.table.xlsx**. We analyse the bearing failures, and come to the conclusion that to calculate the **MTBF** we need context information.
